# CLib FreeRTOS Support

## Overview

The CLib FreeRTOS Support Library provides the necessary hooks to make C library functions such as malloc and free thread safe. This implementation is specific to FreeRTOS and requires it to be present to build. For details on what this library provides see the toolchain specific documentation at:
* ARM: https://developer.arm.com/docs/100073/0614/the-arm-c-and-c-libraries/multithreaded-support-in-arm-c-libraries/management-of-locks-in-multithreaded-applications
* GCC: https://sourceware.org/newlib/libc.html#g_t_005f_005fmalloc_005flock
* IAR: http://supp.iar.com/filespublic/updinfo/011261/arm/doc/EWARM_DevelopmentGuide.ENU.pdf

The startup code must call cy_toolchain_init (for GCC and IAR). This must occur after static data initialization and before static constructors. This is done automatically for PSoC devices. See the PSoC startup files for an example.

To enable Thread Local Storage, configUSE_NEWLIB_REENTRANT must be enabled.

While this is specific to FreeRTOS, it can be used as a basis for supporting other RTOSes as well.

## Requirements
To use this library, the following configuration options must be enabled in FreeRTOSConfig.h:
* configUSE_MUTEXES
* configUSE_RECURSIVE_MUTEXES
* configSUPPORT_STATIC_ALLOCATION

When building with IAR, the '--threaded_lib' argument must also be provided when linking. This is done automatically with psoc6make 1.3.1 and later.

### Time Support Details
When using the HAL (CY_USING_HAL defined) the **time** function returns the time in seconds from microcontroller Real-Time Clock (RTC). Additionally, functions  **cy_set_rtc_instance** and **cy_get_rtc_instance** are provided to interact with the RTC instance used. There are two ways to set this up.
1. Setup using an existing RTC instance:
    * Application initializes RTC using **cyhal_rtc_init** API
    * Application writes the current time to RTC using **cyhal_rtc_write** API
    * Application sets the RTC instance using **cy_set_rtc_instance** API
    * Application calls **time** function to get the time from RTC
2. Allow time to initialize the RTC instance:
    * Application calls **time** function to get the time from RTC. The time function will initializes RTC
    * Application can get the RTC instance using **cy_get_rtc_instance** API
    * Application can write the current time to RTC using **cyhal_rtc_write** API

NOTE: In either flow, until the application calls **cyhal_rtc_write** the RTC will only be initialized with a default time. This means that time deltas will be accurate, but absolute times will not have any relation to the real time.
